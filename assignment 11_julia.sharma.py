#Challenge: Use a loop structure to generate the Collatz sequence until it reaches 1. Handle cases where the user enters a non-numeric input.

#=================================
#Description: Write a program that generates the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer entered by the user. The Collatz sequence is generated iteratively by repeatedly applying the following rules:
#If the current number is even, divide it by 2.
#If the current number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
...

print("Please enter a positive integer: ")
user_input = input("Enter a number: ")

#Validate the input and make sure to repeat until the user enters a positive number
while not user_input.isdigit() or int(user_input) <= 0:
    print("Invalid Input: Please enter a positive number.")
    user_input = input("Enter the number here: ")

#Convert the input into a number
number = int(user_input)

print("Collatz Sequence: ", number)

# generate a loop that will run until it becomes 1
while number !=1:
    print(number, end= "-> ")
    if number % 2 == 0: #if the number is even then divide it by 2
        number = number // 2
    else:
        #if the number is odd then multiply it by 3 and add 1
        number = number * 3 + 1
    print(number)
